# How to contribute ?

## Where to start ?

You can go check out our [open issues](http://github.com/Aquaj/osmosis/issues) for a start.
If you think you are up to resolve any of them, fork the project, develop to your heart's wishes and submit a pull request.

## Under what circumstances will a pull request be merged ?

A pull request should pass the same tests as master and provide its own tests for eventual new code.
That's pretty much all of it !

Once it's been reviewed and approved, it will then be merged into the project.
