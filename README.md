# Ekylibre - Bringing back balance between

Ekylibre is a management application for the agricultural world that's fully-oriented around the core concepts of Open-Source development.
It's built using Ruby on Rails and uses a PostgreSQL/PostGIS stack.

# Osmosis

## Code status

`// TODO`

## What is it ?
Osmosis is a fork of Ekylibre created and as-of-now worked on by a software engineer from Ekylibre's team.
Its goal is to clean and debloat the original project of all the growth pains that have piled up throughout the years.

## Why through a fork instead of the original repo ?
Osmosis is a fork of Ekylibre so there can be as much tinkering and radical changes inside the project without cluttering the branches or slowing down the ongoing developments going on on the root repo.
It is also to better represent that this cleaning-up is a 'side-task' that moves on at its own pace (not to say it cannot be a breakneck one), separated from the timeline of Ekylibre.

If something comes out of it: good. If not: too bad but we won't fret over it.
